## What It Includes

- Four difficulty modes: Easy (220ms), Medium (160ms), Hard (90ms), and Story (progressive speed from 160ms down to 60ms)
- Grid-based snake movement with dynamic tick loop via recursive setTimeout
- Food spawning on unoccupied cells
- Snake growth and score updates when food is eaten
- Pre-game setup to choose `0-5` AI rogue snakes and difficulty mode
- AI snakes that chase food using Manhattan distance, eat fruit, grow, die, and respawn after random delays
- AI snakes spawn from random corners and emerge from the wall over initial ticks
- Symmetric collision rules for player/AI and AI/AI (same-cell head and head-swap collisions)
- Game-over modal includes AI count and difficulty selectors synced with the main setup
- Persistent best-score tracking per AI count and difficulty via localStorage (survives page reloads and server restarts)
- Best-scores panel with independent difficulty filter (Story/Easy/Medium/Hard), defaulting to the active run/setup difficulty on open
- Game over on wall collision, self collision, or rogue collision
- Win/end state when the board is fully filled
- Restart and pause/resume controls
- Mobile-compatible responsive UI for phone and tablet browsers
- Keyboard controls (`Arrow` keys + `WASD`), on-screen touch controls, and board swipe gestures
- 2D sprite visuals: green player snake, red/blue AI snake themes, animated food berry, and textured grass tiles

## Architecture

```
src/
  shared.js           Shared utilities (clampIntRange, clampRandom, toCellKey, cloneSnake, OPPOSITE_DIRECTIONS)
  difficultyConfig.js  Difficulty constants, tick speeds, and Story mode speed formula
  highScoreLogic.js    Per-difficulty score logic: normalization, migration, and updates
  gameLogic.js         Pure game state: movement, collisions, food, scoring
  rogueLogic.js        AI snake behavior: spawning, pathfinding, rogue collisions
  app.js               DOM rendering, event handling, game loop orchestration
  styles.css           Sprite rendering, layout, responsive design
  assets/              SVG sprites (player, rogue-red, rogue-blue, food, tiles)
```

- `gameLogic.js` and `rogueLogic.js` are pure logic with no DOM access, making them fully testable
- `app.js` orchestrates the game loop, wiring state updates to CSS-based sprite rendering
- State is immutable: all updates return new objects via spread

## Patch Notes

- `v0.6.0`: added mobile swipe controls directly on the board (up/down/left/right) with low-latency direction detection on `touchmove`, unified direction handling across keyboard/buttons/swipe, and mobile-safe board touch behavior (`touch-action: none`). Updated docs for mobile compatibility and expanded app behavior coverage to 89 tests with swipe-specific assertions.
- `v0.5.3`: fixed `setDirection` to check `pendingDirection` instead of committed `direction` for reverse-prevention, improving responsiveness for rapid multi-key inputs at high tick speeds (Hard/Story). Expanded test coverage from 68 to 87 tests with new cases for `positionsEqual`, `isInsideBoard`, `createInitialState` defaults, single-segment reversal, all four movement directions, `normalizeHighScores`/`migrateHighScores` null inputs, `clampRandom`/`clampIntRange` Infinity edge cases, empty rogue arrays, and simultaneous multi-rogue collisions.
- `v0.5.2`: refreshed Best Scores UX with `Show/Close Best Scores` wording and a dedicated difficulty filter inside the panel that defaults to the active run/setup difficulty on open while remaining independent from game difficulty selection.
- `v0.5.1`: optimized food spawning by using a two-pass free-cell selection and an explicit occupied-cell set (snake + blocked positions), avoiding large temporary available-cell arrays.
- `v0.5.0`: optimized rogue movement occupancy checks by replacing per-rogue blocked-cell rebuilds with a shared per-tick occupancy map updated incrementally.
- `v0.4.2`: stopped scheduling idle game ticks while paused (and resumed scheduling on unpause), reducing unnecessary timer/render work.
- `v0.4.1`: locked run-specific difficulty and AI count at `Start Game` so tick speed and score persistence stay bound to the active run; prevented game-over score upsert from rerunning on setup edits; and clarified best-score HUD/modal text by including difficulty.
- `v0.4.0`: added four difficulty modes (Easy, Medium, Hard, Story) with per-difficulty high score tracking. Story mode progressively increases speed as you score. Replaced fixed `setInterval` with dynamic `setTimeout` chain for variable tick rates. Added legacy score migration.
- `v0.3.2`: internal refactoring and performance improvements — consolidated duplicate utilities (`toCellKey`, `clampIntRange`), eliminated redundant DOM rebuilds in score panel, and removed wasted idle-tick work.
- `v0.3.1`: added persistent per-AI best score tracking with localStorage, plus a “Best Scores by AI” panel toggle.
- `v0.3.0`: upgraded board rendering with 2D sprite visuals for player snake (green head/body/tail), AI snakes (red/blue themes), animated food, and textured background/frame styling.
- `v0.2.1`: fixed rogue spawn rendering edge case where emerging off-board segments could appear on the opposite side of the grid.
- `v0.2`: added symmetric AI collisions (player/rogue and rogue/rogue head-on and head-swap detection) and updated documentation.
- `v0.1`: initial release with configurable 0-5 AI rogue snakes and basic game mechanics.

## Tech Stack

- Plain JavaScript modules (`src/app.js`, `src/gameLogic.js`, `src/rogueLogic.js`, `src/shared.js`, `src/highScoreLogic.js`, `src/difficultyConfig.js`)
- HTML/CSS UI (`index.html`, `src/styles.css`)
- SVG sprite assets (`src/assets/`)
- Node built-in test runner (`node --test`)

No external runtime dependencies are required.

## Run Locally

Requirements:

- Node.js 18+ (for test runner and npm scripts)
- Python 3 (used by the dev server script)

Install and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:4173
```

## Controls

- Configure AI snakes: choose count (`0-5`) and difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard/Story), then press `Start Game` / `Apply & Restart`
- At game over, change AI count or difficulty in modal and press `Play Again` to restart with new values
- Move: `Arrow Up/Down/Left/Right`, `W/A/S/D`, on-screen direction buttons, or swipe directly on the board
- Mobile compatibility: layout scales for small screens and supports direct board swipes
- Optional mouse controls on desktop: toggle `Show On-Screen Controls`
- View per-AI best-score table: toggle `Show Best Scores` / `Close Best Scores`, then choose panel difficulty from the dropdown
- Pause/Resume: `Space` or `Pause` button
- Restart: `R`, `Restart` button, or modal `Play Again`

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: starts a static server on port `4173`
- `npm test`: runs tests in `tests/appBehavior.test.js`, `tests/gameLogic.test.js`, `tests/rogueLogic.test.js`, `tests/shared.test.js`, `tests/highScoreLogic.test.js`, and `tests/difficultyConfig.test.js`

## Test Coverage (Core Logic)

89 tests across six test files:

**App behavior** (`tests/appBehavior.test.js`):
- Run difficulty remains locked for active tick timing and HUD best label
- Run AI count remains locked during active gameplay
- Pausing stops scheduled ticks until resumed
- Scores panel difficulty mirrors active run on open but stays independent
- Game-over score summary does not change when modal setup selectors are edited
- Swipe input applies direction on `touchmove` (without waiting for `touchend`)
- Touch movement below swipe threshold does not change direction

**Shared utilities** (`tests/shared.test.js`):
- `clampIntRange` clamping, truncation, NaN, and Infinity handling
- `toCellKey` coordinate serialization
- `clampRandom` edge cases (NaN, negative, >= 1, Infinity, valid pass-through)
- `cloneSnake` deep copy independence
- `OPPOSITE_DIRECTIONS` mapping correctness

**Difficulty config** (`tests/difficultyConfig.test.js`):
- Fixed tick values for Easy, Medium, Hard
- Unknown difficulty fallback to Medium
- Story mode formula at boundaries (score 0, 3, 24, 27+)
- Story mode floor enforcement (60ms minimum)
- Negative score safety, delegation from `getTickMs`

**Score logic** (`tests/highScoreLogic.test.js`):
- Per-difficulty score map creation and normalization
- Normalization with null and non-object inputs
- Difficulty+AI-count-specific best retrieval
- Record update behavior (new record vs no change)
- Ordered row projection for the “Best Scores by AI” panel
- Legacy key migration (`”0”` → `”0:MEDIUM”`) and skip for already-migrated scores
- Migration with null input

**Game logic** (`tests/gameLogic.test.js`):
- Movement per tick in all four directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)
- Growth + score increment when eating food
- Wall collision game-over
- Self collision game-over
- Filled-board end condition
- Reverse-direction input prevention via `pendingDirection`
- Rapid multi-key sequences allowed (RIGHT→UP→LEFT, UP→RIGHT→DOWN)
- Pause/resume toggling and game-over guard
- `stepState` no-op when paused or game over
- Direction input validation (invalid and duplicate inputs)
- Food placement on valid empty cells only (including full-board edge case)
- `positionsEqual` matching and non-matching coordinates
- `isInsideBoard` in-bounds and out-of-bounds positions
- `createInitialState` default grid, center snake, and initial values
- Single-segment snake reversal allowance

**Rogue AI** (`tests/rogueLogic.test.js`):
- Rogue snake spawn, movement, growth, and respawn behavior
- Rogue spawn returns null when all corners are occupied
- Rogue segment collection and filtering by ID
- Rogue segment collection with empty rogue array
- Rogue pathfinding with null food (random fallback)
- Rogue avoidance of other rogues' occupied cells
- Rogue/player and rogue/rogue collision outcomes (body-hit, same-cell head-on, and head-swap)
- Multiple rogues hitting player simultaneously

## Manual Verification Checklist

- Start game and verify snake moves continuously
- Choose different difficulty modes and verify speed difference is noticeable
- In Story mode, eat food and observe speed increasing in status bar
- Choose different AI counts (`0-5`) and verify they apply on Start
- Confirm keyboard controls respond as expected
- Confirm touch/on-screen controls work on small screens
- Confirm board swipe controls (up/down/left/right) work on mobile devices
- Eat food and verify snake length + score increase by 1
- Verify AI snakes chase food, can eat fruit, and respawn after dying
- Verify player head into rogue body causes game over
- Verify rogue head into player body kills rogue and player survives
- Verify player/rogue head-on and head-swap collisions defeat both
- Verify rogue/rogue head-on and head-swap collisions defeat both rogues
- Hit a wall and verify game-over modal appears
- Hit snake body and verify game-over modal appears
- Pause and resume without state corruption
- Restart from both button and modal and verify score resets
